# ReactJS Tic Tac Toe

This is my completed copy of the ReactJS tutorial project where you create a copy of Tic Tac Toe, plus the additional extras they suggest.

Including
1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
    - Actually did not care for the appearance of that so I had the button display the board at each step (code for other format is still there)
2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
